          <div class="overlay"><strong>Teknofest Robotaksi Binek Otonom</strong> <br> I participated as a finalist in the Teknofest Robotaxi Autonomous Vehicle Competition. During this process, I developed autonomous driving algorithms and worked on real-time data processing and sensor integration. I designed AI and ROS-based systems to enable safe and efficient vehicle movement. This competition was an invaluable experience that enhanced my engineering skills and allowed me to contribute to the future of autonomous vehicle technology.</div>

          <div class="overlay"><strong>Teknofest Hava Savunma Sistemleri</strong> <br> In the Teknofest Air Defense Systems Competition, I developed a turret system capable of tracking targets, identifying friend or foe, and neutralizing threats. Using AI and computer vision, I designed a defense mechanism that automatically detects, classifies, and follows balloon targets. The system quickly identifies threats and responds effectively, offering a strategic solution in air defense technology. This experience allowed me to enhance my engineering skills in the field of defense systems.</div>
